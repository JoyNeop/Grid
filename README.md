# Grid

Use the `index.html` or [online version] (http://joyneop.github.io/grid/) to design a grid. Read the source code to learn undocumented features.

## Use as webpage background

You don't have to capture it, instead, just let it generated by JavaScript. The `minimum.html` is a framework which may help you utilize the fun.

If you want it to be interactive, see the `interactive.html` as framework.

With the JSON format grid saved, as parameter, you call the anonymous function. Then the anonymous function will generate one. Not sure if it's compatible with a scrollable page. I'll checkout this later.

Please keep my information as inline comment in the anonymous function provided with the `minimum.html`, if you want to use it as background in your work.

Don't create derive versions, please. I'm not so familiar with that.
